    <p>You can find Teng Siong Ong aka siong1987 <a href="http://twitter.com/holman">on Twitter</a>
    or send him <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x73;&#x69;&#x6f;&#110;&#103;&#49;&#57;&#56;&#55;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">an email</a>.</p>

    <p>Zach works at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. When he's not
    doing that, he's <a href="http://zachholman.com">blogging</a>, hacking on
    <a href="https://github.com/holman">open source</a>, and <a
    href="http://zachholman.com/screencasts">filming screencasts</a> that are
    anything but "traditional" screencasts. He attracted national media fame
    and glory when he built <a href="http://facelette.com">Facelette</a>, a
    ridiculous three-hour experiment, and lost all of it again after admitting
    he sometimes stays home on Friday nights and replies to support emails.</p>

    <p>Zach has also been working on <a
    href="http://www.good-tutorials.com">Good-Tutorials</a> since 2002. It's
    amassed tens of thousands of technology tutorials over the last decade.
    Good-Tutorials has been featured on the BBC, SkyNews, TechTV (now G4), PC
    World, and other fine journalistic endeavors.</a>

    <p>If you have any questions or feedback, check out the issues on <a
    href="https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1">holman/feedback</a>
    on GitHub. It's sort of like an "Ask Me Anything" setup, except it uses a
    nerdy social network and crams it into a bug tracker.</p>
