    <h4>SmoQe BBQ & Wood Fired Pizza</h4>
    <img src="/images/travel/bbq.jpeg" />
    <p>When done right, there are certain foods that cannot be improved upon. Slow Smoked BBQ and Wood Fired Pizza are those kinds of foods. Our BBQ and our Pizza are cooked with 100% wood, just like they have been for thousands of years. No gas, no electricity, no shortcuts. We dry rub our BBQ and slow smoke it for hours until it’s perfect. We don’t cover it up with sauce; we serve it on the side so that you can enjoy it however you like it. Our wood fired pizza starts with organic house-made dough that takes 3 days to make. We then top it with the finest organic all natural ingredients and cook it in an authentic Italian wood fired pizza oven. Why go though all this work? The reason for this is simple; it’s the only way to get the absolute best BBQ and Pizza possible.</p>
