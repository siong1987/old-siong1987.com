    <h2>Open Sources</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3><a href="/talk/a-documentation-talk">A Documentation Talk</a></h3>

      <div class="link"><a href="/talk/a-documentation-talk">View the slides and video</a></div>

      <div class="details">
        <p>"A Documentation Talk" sounds pretty boring, right? Wouldn't it be
        *scandalously titillating* if this talk's title included detailed
        analysis of the expectations and results of the talk itself? Jeez it's
        like someone's making an overt metaphor for how Rubyists document their
        code.</p>
