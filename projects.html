      <div class="link"><a href="https://github.com/siong1987/yab62">View the gem</a></div>

      <div class="details">
        <p>This is the first Rubygem that I wrote with C extension. In fact, this gem can be used to make url-shortener faster by converting integer to base 62. I created this because there are many gems out there which are implemented in pure Ruby. So, I decided to create one with C extension to see how fast it can go. And, the results is amazing.</p>
