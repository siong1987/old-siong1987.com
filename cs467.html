    <p>Mail Time, the minimalist e-mail visualization, is a tool used to analyze a Gmail accountâ€™s incoming and outgoing messages in various increments. Using a simple two-color interface, Mail Time shows the relation of incoming and outgoing messages on in hour, day, or month increments. Additionally, a user can bring up groups or a specific person merely by clicking in the clock. The settings can be modified by a hidden menu bar, brought up by hovering over its location.</p>

	<p>We believe our minimalist approach will combine the intuitive approach to analyzing e-mail and providing a eye-pleasing, mind-soothing visualization. Mail Time merely takes what you already know and love (or hate, depending on your mood) - your e-mail - and making it interesting and unique to you.</p>
