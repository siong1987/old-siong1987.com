    <p>Mail Time, the minimalist e-mail visualization, is a tool used to analyze a Gmail accountâ€™s incoming and outgoing messages in various increments. Using a simple two-color interface, Mail Time shows the relation of incoming and outgoing messages on in hour, day, or month increments. Additionally, a user can bring up groups or a specific person merely by clicking in the clock. The settings can be modified by a hidden menu bar, brought up by hovering over its location.</p>

	<p>We believe our minimalist approach will combine the intuitive approach to analyzing e-mail and providing a eye-pleasing, mind-soothing visualization. Mail Time merely takes what you already know and love (or hate, depending on your mood) - your e-mail - and making it interesting and unique to you.</p>

	<p>There are in fact three modes in Mail Time. The monthly mode, the weekly mode and the hourly mode.</p>

	<p>When you start up Mail Time, you will see an aggregated count of emails based on received time and sent time of all the mail in your inbox. This is the monthly mode which shows the number of emails you received and sent monthly.</p>

	<p>By clicking on the aggregated, it will lead you to the group mode. It shows the time you usually sent or received emails based on groups. These two circles are in the hourly mode.</p>

	<p>By clicking on on the group mode again, it will lead you to a more detailed mode based on contact. Here, you can see the time you usually sent or received from Bob. This one is in weekly mode.</p>
