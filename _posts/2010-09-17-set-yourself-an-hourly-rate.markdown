To be a startup founder is hard, you have to work on so many stuff like coding the backend, designing the website, deploying the server, etc. All these things take time.

In fact, there are many things that you can do to be more productive. Over the years, the most important productivity tip that I learned is to set yourself an <b>hourly rate</b>.

## How

So, how this actually will save you time? It's really easy. Think about the jobs that are currently on your to-do list. Think about the hours that you have to spent on each job.

For example, a job called "design the frontpage" might take you <b>5 hours</b> to complete. Let's say that your hourly rate is <b>USD30 per hour</b>. This means that you will have to spend a total worth of <b>USD150</b> time to finish this particular job.

Now, if you outsource the job to an outside designer, you may just have to spend <b>USD100</b> to get the job done. Indirectly, this actually helps save you <b>USD50</b>. But, do remember to calculate the <b>offset time</b> you might have to spend to communicate with the designer.

The time that you save will become even more significant if you apply this tip on stuff like cooking<b>(2 hours spent = USD60)</b> vs eating out<b>(1 hour spent = USD30)</b>, walking<b>(0.5 hour spent = USD15)</b> vs driving<b>(10 mins spent = USD5)</b>, etc.

So, set yourself an hourly rate!
