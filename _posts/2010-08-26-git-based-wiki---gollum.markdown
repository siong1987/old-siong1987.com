[Github][1] has just launched a new interesting project called gollum. [gollum][2] is a Git-based wiki that works like, yeah, Git.

## Installation

Installation is as easy:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install gollum
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have installed gollum, go into any git-based repository and run `gollum`. Bam. Now, your repository is a wiki. And, collaboration can happen like any Git repository.

As a sidenote, I personally use [gollum][2] as my personal wiki. : )
