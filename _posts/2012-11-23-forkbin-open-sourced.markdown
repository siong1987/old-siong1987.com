[Forkbin][1] is github for lists.  You can fork others lists or create
your own.  You can use the site at [http://forkbin.com][1].

Jared and me created the site at Techcrunch hackathon few months ago.

The main component that is being used in the project is
[Backbone.Routes][2].  Many people have asked me to create a example
project that uses Backbone.Routes.  Forkbin uses Backbone.Routes, so, you can see
how it works from the code.

If you are interested in how Forkbin or Backbone.Routes works, check out
the code at [github][3].
