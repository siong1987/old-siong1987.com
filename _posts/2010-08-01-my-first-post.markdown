This is not the first time I actually want to get myself on serious blogging. I moved from [Wordpress][1] to [Posterous][2]. Now, I am running this on [Heroku][3] with [toto][4].

## How to use Toto?

If you are looking to setup something similar like this with toto, you can refer to Dmitry Fadeyev's [Getting Started With Toto][5].

## Why Toto?

There are a few reasons that I picked toto:

* version control with GitHub
* written in Ruby(I know Ruby pretty well.)
* easy deployment via Heroku
* HTTP caching via Varnish(Heroku supports it.)
* lightweight blogging platform(Wordpress has too many features that I don't want.)

Okay. Done with my first post. Please tell me what you want me to write about in the comment area.
