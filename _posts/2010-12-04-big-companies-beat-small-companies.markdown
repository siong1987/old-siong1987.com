People always ask me.

"Why can't Google creates this X product to kill this X company?"

When Netflix started, many people think that Blockbuster can kill Netflix easily. But, just a few weeks ago, Blockbuster declared their bankruptcy and Netflix is growing like crazy.

## Why?

Because:

* Big companies especially listed companies has to care about their investors money in their companies.
* There are many factors other than money to create a successful business, for example, talents, relationships.
* Bureaucracy in big companies.

What do you think?
