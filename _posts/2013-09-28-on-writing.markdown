description: My inaugural post on at least writing two to three posts a week.
---

Writing has been on my New Year's resolutions list for a while, yet I have never actually worked on it.  This post is meant to be a way for me to get started and my goal is to at least write two to three posts a week.  Initially, I wanted to start with a more ambitious goal of writing at least one post a day, but I was worried that I might end up writing for the sake of writing.  I always prefer quality over quantity.  Words are meant to be concise and meaningful.

I admire people who can write well and particularly on interesting and insightful topics.  Some of the best writing that I have read are from [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) and [Fred Wilson](http://avc.com/).  Every time there is a new essay from PG, people on the Internet will talk about it.  The essay goes up on the front page of Hacker News, and within seconds of it being published, it will gain hundreds of up votes -- sometimes thousands.  I love PG's essays not because they're well written, but because they come with insight that only he can actually write from his experience helping many startups at a Y Combinator.

Fred Wilson at Union Square Ventures writes at least [one post a day](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/09/the-avc-funnel.html).  I favor his style of short and simple writing.  Sometimes, he will just post YouTube videos that he finds interesting.  Sometimes, he will write about problems that he thinks are worth solving.  Sometimes, he will talk about random thoughts he encounters in life.  He recently published a post titled ["Writing It Down"](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/09/writing-it-down.html), where he discusses about how writing helps him to be good at venture investing.  Like Fred Wilson, I want to write down my thoughts on the things that I like, which are: startups, new technology, Apple, and product management, etc. I want to write about these topics in order to improve my thinking.  Some of these writings are already on my Evernote, but they are pretty unorganized and I might want to reorganize them and republish them here one day.

In order to write good, I decide on a few things that will help me.  To get well versed in my writing and get better in my vocabulary, I decide on a few books that might help me:

* [The Book on Writing](http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-on-Writing-ebook/dp/B00D33KPD8/?tag=siong1987-20)
* [Revising Prose](http://www.amazon.com/Revising-Prose-Edition-Richard-Lanham/dp/0321441699/?tag=siong1987-20)
* [The Elements of Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X/?tag=siong1987-20)
* [On Writing Well](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548/?tag=siong1987-20)

I also signed up for some online writing classes from Udemy and Skillshare:

* [Becoming A Writer](https://www.udemy.com/becoming-a-writer-exercises/)
* [How to Write (Smart) About Pop Culture](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/writing-and-publishing/How-to-Write-Smart-About-Pop-Culture/929130307?via=search)

[Draft](https://draftin.com/)'s "Ask A Pro" feature seems like a good way to improve my writing too.  It will cost me $7 for every 15 minutes of copy-editing on my post.  I also bought myself some really good [pens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FSZP5A/?tag=siong1987-20) under the recommendation of [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/) and will start using my [Moleskine notebook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8866137634/?tag=siong1987-20) more regularly to write down my thoughts when my computer isn't around.  I find it weirdly satisfied to write with pen and paper.

Some of you might have already noticed that most of the links to products in this post are affiliate links from Amazon.  This is from my decision to start monetizing my writings, but I doubt that I will ever make enough money from Amazon.  This is just an opportunity for me to try out how the user experience of the Amazon Associates Program is from a product perspective (which is one of the topics I will write on more).

As a programmer myself, I think that it is important to end this post by talking about what is the backend behind this blog.  This blog is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which I did a few years ago and is hosted on GitHub.  I am using Google Analytics for traffic analytics.  I still do not like the design of the website.  And, the general readability of this blog can still be improved.  I will find some time to work on these issues.

Let's start the experiment.  :)
