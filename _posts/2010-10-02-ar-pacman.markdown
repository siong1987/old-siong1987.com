title: AR Pacman
description: My first project in Node.js
---

It is an Augmented Reality Pacman working on the iPhone, viewing realtime via the web browser.

## Hack

It was a 24 hours non-sleep hack that we built overnight with an idea in mind.

## How

We built the server side using [Node.js][2] and the client side using the network library in iOS. The web browser uses HTML5 (Canvas) to display the pacman maze overlaying on a Google Map. It also uses Comet (long-held HTTP request) to retrieve information from the server in realtime. We use [Socket.IO][3] here which provides fallback mechanism that depends on the browser. For example, Safari will use HTML5 Websocket, Firefox will use Flash socket, and Chrome will use long-polling.

We use JSON to communicate between the web server and the web clients.

## Team
