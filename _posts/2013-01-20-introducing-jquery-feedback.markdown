title: Introducing jQuery Feedback
description: A clone of Branch.com Feedback Widget
---

Recently, I discovered the beautiful feedback widget at [Branch][1].
So, I decided to create a clone of it.

<img src="/images/jquery.feedback.gif" />

Check out [jQuery.feedback][2].

Note: I wonder what tool people use to create gif.  At least the one I
am using now obviously sucks!
