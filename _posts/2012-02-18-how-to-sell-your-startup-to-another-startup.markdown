title: How to Sell Your Startup to another Startup
description: My experience on selling GraffitiGeo to another startup.
---

I [sold][2] [GraffitiGeo][3] a few years ago. For those who do not know what GraffitiGeo was, it was actually a location based application. We started GraffitiGeo in late 2008 and we are funded by [Y Combinator][4] as part of the Summer 2009 batch. We released GraffitiGeo on Jun 9th, 2009. About 3 months later, GraffitiGeo was acquired.

Obviously, the above is just a summarization of what happenned during that short period. But, I would write a more detailed post on what actually happenned and what I had learned during that period. In this post, I want to write about the lessons I learned by <b>selling my startup to another startup</b>.

## Do your due diligence
The acquirer will do due diligence on your company to make sure that your company and your team is good enough. For GraffitiGeo, we were only three cofounders. Basically, we had to go through the normal interview process that most job applicants had to go through. It was my first real interview in a professional settings. Personally, I think that most interview processes are stupid. But, that would be a separated post about it.

But, what I am trying to say here is that you should do your own due diligence about the acquirer too. Things work both way. An acquisition from someone does not mean that you are at a lower position to negotiate. And, we failed to do exactly that. You should try to talk to the current employees in the acquirer's company and to see whether the place provides the environment you want to work in. Talk to the employees who have left the company and ask them why.

Try to look at the big picture of the acquirer.

## Understand the financial situation of the acquirer
For us, GraffitiGeo was acquired by another startup. So, it was very important for us to understand the financial situation of the acquirer. And, I think we did this quite well but there were still things that we could still improve on.

First, you must know how much cash your acquirer has in the bank. It is very important because startups live or die with the cash in their bank accounts. You do not want to work in a company that will die in a few months after you are acquired.

Second, you should know the total "preference" number from the acquirer. If your acquirer is sold, the prefferred stocks are cashed out first, then only the common stocks holder will get the rest of the money. And, those preferred stocks are usually owned by the investors. This is important because it literally means what price the acquirer has to be sold for in order to make enough money for the stocks you own from the acquisition of your company.

Besides, it also affects what you are getting from your acquirer.

## What are you getting
CASH. CASH. CASH.

I cannot emphasize this enough. Nothing is more important than cash. If your company is acquired, you want some cash out of it. But, usually, if your acquirer is still a startup, cash is usually the last thing they can offer to you. So, in most cases, you will get equity instead of cash. And, there is another catch here if you are getting equity from your acquirer. The question you should ask yourself here is whether you are getting the stocks or the options.

Stocks is definitely better than options. Obviously, you are not going to get preferred stocks here, so, I would argue for larger amount of common stocks if your acquirer has large "preference" number(see above)/in later stage. But, this depends on case by case. I miss out a lot of details here. You should do your own homework on this.

## Vesting
If you are getting stocks as compensation for your startup, it is common to have vesting. And, it is the only way for them to keep you working in the company. Vesting is usually the standard 4 years vesting with one year cliff.

You can usually argue to remove the one year cliff and accelerate/shorten the vesting period since you have been working on your startup for some time. But, don't sweat too much on this.

## Salary
This is obvious, you should argue for the highest salary possible especially your acquirer is a late stage company. We did a mistake here but I did not want to reveal the detailed financial figures here.

Also, you should do due diligence and see what others are getting in the company. You should get more or less as others are getting in the company. Not way lower!!!

## Acquisition talk as background process
We learned this from Paul Graham. You should treat your acquisition talk as background process. You should not get too engaged about it and instead you should focus on your startup. Deal fails most of the time and the best way to make your acquisition comes through is to keep getting more and more traction for your startup.

At GraffitiGeo, I do not think that we were doing this good enough. I was too excited for the acquisition talk since if GraffitiGeo was acquired, I could brag about it. But, now I know that acquisition means nothing and sometimes it is a sign of failure. I learned this the hard way so I wish that you do not repeat after me. Go big or die nothing.

## Know your base price
You should know how much you would want to sell your startup for. Initially, we at GraffitiGeo had a higher price that we would want the startup to be acquired for. But, we settled for a lower amount. And, you should not do this unless you have already lost motivation to keep working on your startup.

You should not settle for a lower price. If the acquirer cannot afford to pay your base price, keep working.

## Shop your offer
We were told not to shop our offer during the period of the acquisition talk. Now, I think that you should definitely do that. You should shop your offer and it is usually the sure fire way to get matching or better offers from other competing companies who are working on the same field.

I might be wrong on this. So, you might not want to listen to this. If you are someone who has similar experience on this, I would be happy to hear your opinions on this. Just shoot me an email.

## Listen to yourself
From a writeup on Business Insider on Ben Silbermann of [Pinterest][5]'s SXSW talk:

<blockquote>
“Don’t take too much advice,” says Silbermann. “Most people who have a lot of advice to give — with a few exceptions — generalize whatever they did,” he says.
</blockquote>

So, one last advice to you is that you should just take my advice here as part of your learning. Do not follow them because I say so.

Listen to yourself.

Usually, acquisition is used as a tool for bigger startup to kill a competitor which is usually a smaller startup. Try to think about the whole acquisition and decide whether you want your startup to be part of another startup. 99% of the time you do not want to.

Lastly, I encourage you to read this post, [Startup Equity For Employees][1], as well because most of the things there might be applicable in an acquisition talk too.
