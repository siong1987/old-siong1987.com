Recently, I see more and more people start using Rails with [jQuery][3]. The Rails Core team actually maintains a jQuery [rails.js][2] file. But, Rails 3 doesn't have an option for you to start with jQuery as the default Javascript library.

Hence, I decided to patch this feature myself. With my patch, you can start a Rails 3 project with jQuery as the default Javascript library with the "-j" option. And, it accepts both "jquery" or "prototype" as its parameter.

In short, you can start a Rails 3 project with jQuery in this way:
    rails new my_cool_project -j jquery
    
And, to skip Javascript at all. You can do:
    rails new my_cool_project --skip-javascript
    
which I think is better than the "--skip-prototype" option Rails 3 provides now. Want to see this get into the future Rails 3 release? Do +1 [here][1] at Lighthouse.

Edit: Finally, the commit is [in][4].
