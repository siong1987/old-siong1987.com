title: Virtuous Investment Circle Sounds Fishy
description: VIC is a new and fishy angel group in Malaysia
---

[Virtuous Investment Circle][4] is a new angel group in Malaysia. According to their mission statement:

<blockquote>
The Virtuous Investment Circle (ViC) is an independent
non-profit organisation that aims to create a vibrant
ecosystem for angel investing in Malaysia.
</blockquote>

So, they are supposed to be an independent <b>non-profit
organisation</b>. But, later in their FAQ, they stated that:

## Charge

<blockquote>
There will be a nominal fee of RM500 for each investment
proposal to be submitted to the ViC. There will also be a
3% to 5% commission for projects that have successfully
received investments from ViC angel investors.
</blockquote>

So, it seems like there is a <b>nominal</b> fee of <b>RM500</b> that they
charge for each investment proposal. And, each successful investment
that is made throught VIC, there is a <b>3% to 5%</b> commission. Are they
going to use this money for good causes? Or, are they just going to
split this money among the people in VIC? So, basically, this means that
as long as the organisation is not making any profit(because the money
has already splitted among the people in VIC), you can claim that you
are running a non-profit organisation?

Before I move on, let's do a simple math here. VIC charges <b>RM500</b>
for each investment proposal. In US, incubator like Y Combinator gets
around 1k application per round, which is about 2k per year. Let's
assume that VIC only gets 10% of this number, which is <b>200</b> per year.
They are making an awesome amount of <b>RM100k</b> per year just by reading
investment proposals by poor entrepreneurs like you and me.

## Bullshit Reasons

According to their website, they also said that:

<blockquote>
The reason we charge a nominal RM500 fee for each submission 
is that we want to ensure that the companies who are applying
to ViC are really serious about getting funded by angel 
investors.
</blockquote>

Actually, there are many ways to tackle this problem. I have a
simple solution here. Since they claim that they are a <b>non-profit 
organisation</b>, I suggest that they can ask each entrepreneur to 
attach a RM500 [World Vision Malaysia][1] donation receipt with 
each investment proposal submitted to you.

## Commission

Now, let's talk about the <b>3% to 5%</b> commission that VIC are going to take
from each successful investment. How are they going to spend the money?
There is no clear explanation on their website on how they are going to
utilize the money. For all the investors who are interested to invest
through VIC, please think twice, your investment will get sliced out by
VIC before it gets to the hand of your shiny new investment. Btw, if you
are interested to invest in local companies, you can contact me. I know
many local entrepreneurs who actually want your money without the <b>3% to
5%</b> cut off.

On their latest PR stunt on [Sin Chew][2], they claimed that about 200 new
companies were created by the investment from about 40 ex-googlers. But,
you have to know that these ex-googlers don't charge people to pitch to
them. And, VIC do. There is a huge difference here.

Before I end this post, if you are people from VIC reading this post:

## Drop the Charge 

Seriously, VIC, drop your <b>RM500</b> pitching fee if you really
want to help local entrepreneurs. And, if you do want to charge a <b>3% to
5%</b> commission, don't claim that you are a non-profit organisation. One
last thing, be transparent with what you have. You sound really fishy to
many of us.
