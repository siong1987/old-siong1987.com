title: Take Out of Context 
description: It is so scary to report thing out of context.

I had a friend who is a journalist. He told me that he only writes "what
actually happened".  Below was a short video he posted on his Facebook
account after the Bersih 3.0 protest in Malaysia yesterday.

type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315"
allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Note that the video is posted under the official Police Department
Youtube account with comment disabled and the description "Police car
vandalized and overturned".

But, this is what actually happened.

allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

This is how scary thing can be to be taken out of context.  And, I never
expect professional journalism to work this way.
