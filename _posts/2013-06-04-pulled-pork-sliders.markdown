## Ingrediants

* 1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
* 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle root beer
* 1 (18 ounce) bottle your favorite barbecue sauce
* 8 hamburger buns, split and lightly toasted

## Directions

1. Place the pork tenderloin in a slow cooker; pour the root beer over the meat. Cover and cook on low until well cooked and the pork shreds easily, 6 to 7 hours. Note: the actual length of time may vary according to individual slow cooker. Drain well. Stir in barbecue sauce. Serve over hamburger buns.

## Notes

* I only cooked the pork tenderlions for 5 hours on low but I used two 1-pound pork tenderlions instead.
