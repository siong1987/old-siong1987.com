description: FLOChip is my new venture.
---

Recently, if you have noticed, I have stopped writing on this blog. In fact, I have slowly shifted my writings to my new blog at [FLOChip blog][1]. [FLOChip][2] in fact is the company that I started and have been working on for the past year. It is basically a web workshop that explores the local internet market in Malaysia/South East Asia.

## Projects

Some web apps that we have built are:

* [WeiLangWang][3] - an online Chinese radio
* [dearppl][4] - Brighten Someoneâ€™s Day, One Apology At A Time.
* [31Storey][5] - Ebay + Facebook. A social platform for anyone who likes fashion.
* [SlurpMAG][6] - Online food magazine in Malaysia.
* [PuffyLAB][7] - Online tees branding.

Btw, we do take outside contracts as a source income to support our exploration on the web.

## Contracts

Contracts that we have worked on:

* [ShoonFatt Biscuit Factory][8] - Web design, content management system and Facebook page management.
* [Genting Casinos][9] - HTML/CSS Conversion and some basic javascript widgets.
* [iBilik][10] - Web redesign.

As you can see we are pretty everywhere related to web technologies, email me siong [at] flochip dot com if you have an interesting project that you want us to work on. :)
