description: Being an engineer founder in a startup is just not enough.

<blockquote>
"Once we get this iPhone client out, usage of the app will definitely increase!!!", said Engineer.
</blockquote>

iPhone client launched, Techcrunch didn't pick up the news.  Growth curve stayed flat.

<blockquote>
"We are working on the Android client now, I believe it will help to boost the user growth.", said Engineer.
</blockquote>

The Android client didn't get featured on Google Play store, no one seemed to care.  User growth didn't pick up.

<blockquote>
"This Facebook Open Graph integration will help us to convert more Facebook users to use our app.", said Engineer.
</blockquote>

The annoying Facebook notifications started showing up on Facebook.  Your initial users complained.  No new users were converted from Facebook.

Engineer felt powerless.  He started doubting his magical engineering power which he thought that would help to grow his little unknown startup to millions of users.

## Product Market Fit

Many people do not realize how important product market fit is for a startup.

Instagram didn't launch their Android client a year and half after the Instagram iPhone client launched.  At this point, Instagram already had millions of users.

Pinterest didn't have their iPhone client until their users started complaining about the lack of an iPhone client.  Since the launch of the Pinterest iPhone client, the app has stayed in the top 100 free apps in the iOS App Store.

Fab recently acquired their 85-person engineering team, True Sparrow Systems, that is based in Pune, India.  True Sparrow Systems had been working with Jason Goldberg, founder of Fab, on socialmedian, fabulis and then the pivot, Fab.  This happened after Fab has made ten of millions of sales.

I used to (and sometimes still do) make the mistakes the Engineer made.  It is inevitable to deal with [schleps][1] if you want to build a successful business.
